# ✅ Profile Page Error Fixed!

## 🐛 Problem Found & Fixed

**Error**: Profile page crashed with "Something went wrong"

**Cause**: Variable name mismatch - code was using `search` but the variable is `searchParams`

**Solution**: Changed all instances of `search.get()` to `searchParams.get()`

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **Before (Broken):**
```javascript
const sharedStory = search.get('story')  // ❌ 'search' is undefined
const sharedReel = search.get('reel')    // ❌ 'search' is undefined
const sharedPost = search.get('post')    // ❌ 'search' is undefined
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```javascript
const sharedStory = searchParams.get('story')  // ✅ Correct
const sharedReel = searchParams.get('reel')    // ✅ Correct
const sharedPost = searchParams.get('post')    // ✅ Correct
```
